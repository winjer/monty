# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Monty is a sandboxed Python interpreter written in Rust. It parses Python code using Ruff's `ruff_python_parser` but implements its own runtime execution model for safety and performance. This is a work-in-progress project that currently supports a subset of Python features.

Project goals:

- **Safety**: Execute untrusted Python code safely without FFI or C dependencies, instead sandbox will call back to host to run foreign/external functions.
- **Performance**: Fast execution through compile-time optimizations and efficient memory layout
- **Simplicity**: Clean, understandable implementation focused on a Python subset
- **Snapshotting and iteration**: Plan is to allow code to be iteratively executed and snapshotted at each function call

## Build Commands

```bash
# format python and rust code
make format

# lint python and rust code
make lint

# Build the project
cargo build
```

## Exception

It's important that exceptions raised/returned by this library match those raised by Python.

Wherever you see an Exception with a repeated message, create a dedicated method to create that exception `src/exceptions.rs`.

When writing exception messages, always check `src/exceptions.rs` for existing methods to generate that message.

## Code style

Avoid local imports, unless there's a very good reason, all imports should be at the top of the file.

Avoid `fn my_func<T: MyTrait>(..., param: T)` style function definitions, STRONGLY prefer `fn my_func(param: impl MyTrait)` syntax since changes are more localized.

### Docstrings and comments.

IMPORTANT: every struct, enum and function should be a comprehensive but concise docstring to
explain what it does and why and any considerations or potential foot-guns of using that type.

The only exception is trait implementation methods where a docstring is not necessary if the method is self-explanatory.

Only add examples to docstrings of public functions and structs, examples should be <=8 lines, if the example is more, remove it.

If you add example code to docstrings, it must be run in tests. NEVER add examples that are ignored.

Similarly, you should add lots of comments to code.

If you see a comment or docstring that's out of date - you MUST update it to be correct.

NOTE: COMMENTS AND DOCSTRINGS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE PROJECT.

## Tests

Do **NOT** write tests within modules unless explicitly prompted to do so.

Tests should live in the `tests/` directory.

Commands:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests (this is the best way to run all tests as it enables the dec-ref-check feature)
make test

# Run a specific test
cargo test --features dec-ref-check str__ops

# Run the interpreter on a Python file
cargo run -- <file.py>
```

### Test File Structure

**DO NOT create many small test files.** This would be unmaintainable.

ALWAYS consolidate related tests into single files*using multiple `assert` statements. Follow `test_cases/fstring__all.py` as the gold standard pattern:

```python
# === Section name ===
# brief comment if needed
assert condition, 'descriptive message'
assert another_condition, 'another descriptive message'

# === Next section ===
x = setup_value
assert x == expected, 'test description'
```

Each `assert` should have a descriptive message.

### When to Create Separate Test Files

Only create a separate test file when you MUST use one of these special expectation formats:

- `# Raise=Exception('message')` - Test expects an exception (execution stops)
- `# ParseError=message` - Test expects a parse error
- `# ref-counts={...}` - Test checks reference counts (special mode)
- you're writing tests for a different behavior or section of the language

For everything else, **add asserts to an existing test file** or create ONE consolidated file for the feature.

### File Naming

Name files by feature, not by micro-variant:
- ✅ `str__ops.py` - all string operations (add, iadd, len, etc.)
- ✅ `list__methods.py` - all list method tests
- ❌ `str__add_basic.py`, `str__add_empty.py`, `str__add_multiple.py` - TOO GRANULAR

### Expectation Formats (use sparingly)

Only use these when `assert` won't work (on last line of file):
- `# Return=value` - Check `repr()` output (prefer assert instead)
- `# Return.str=value` - Check `str()` output (prefer assert instead)
- `# Return.type=typename` - Check `type()` output (prefer assert instead)
- `# Raise=Exception('message')` - Expect exception (REQUIRES separate file)
- `# ParseError=message` - Expect parse error (REQUIRES separate file)
- `# ref-counts={...}` - Check reference counts (REQUIRES separate file)
- No expectation comment - Assert-based test (PREFERRED)

Do NOT use `# Return=` when you could use `assert` instead

### Skip Directive

Optional, on first line of file - DO NOT use unless absolutely necessary:
- `# skip=cpython` - Skip CPython test (only run on Monty)
- `# skip=monty` - Skip Monty test (only run on CPython)

Ask for approval before using `skip`!

### Other Notes

- Prefer single quotes for strings in Python tests
- do NOT add `# noqa` comments to test code, instead add the failing code to `pyproject.toml`
- Run `make lint-py` after adding tests
- Use `make complete-tests` to fill in blank expectations
- Tests run via `datatest-stable` harness in `tests/datatest_runner.rs`

## Reference Counting

Heap-allocated values (`Value::Ref`) use manual reference counting. Key rules:

- **Cloning**: Use `clone_with_heap(heap)` which increments refcounts for `Ref` variants.
- **Dropping**: Call `drop_with_heap(heap)` when discarding an `Value` that may be a `Ref`.
- **Borrow conflicts**: When you need to read from the heap and then mutate it, use `copy_for_extend()` to copy the `Value` without incrementing refcount, then call `heap.inc_ref()` separately after the borrow ends.

Container types (`List`, `Tuple`, `Dict`) also have `clone_with_heap()` methods.

**Resource limits**: When resource limits (allocations, memory, time) are exceeded, execution terminates with a `ResourceError`. No guarantees are made about the state of the heap or reference counts after a resource limit is exceeded. The heap may contain orphaned objects with incorrect refcounts. This is acceptable because resource exhaustion is a terminal error - the execution context should be discarded.

## NOTES

ALWAYS consider code quality when adding new code, if functions are getting too complex or code is duplicated, move relevant logic to a new file.
Make sure functions are added in the most logical place, e.g. as methods on a struct where appropriate.

The code should follow the "newspaper" style where public and primary functions are at the top of the file, followed by private functions and utilities.

ALWAYS run `make lint` after making changes and fix all suggestions to maintain code quality.

ALWAYS update this file when it is out of date.

NEVER write `unsafe` code, if you think you need to write unsafe code, explicitly ask the user or leave a `todo!()` with a suggestion and explanation.
